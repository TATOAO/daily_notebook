**SPP** Serial Port Profile（串口配置文件）

其定义了使用蓝牙进行RS232（或类似）串行电缆仿真的设备应使用的协议和过程。简单来说就是在蓝牙设备之间建立虚拟的串口进行数据通信。

## GATT

“The GATT Profile specifies the structure in which profile data is exchanged. This structure defines basic elements such as services and characteristics, used in a profile.”

## Service

“A service is a collection of data and associated behaviors to accomplish a particular function or feature. [...] A service definition may contain […] mandatory characteristics and optional characteristics.”

## Characteristic

“A characteristic is a value used in a service along with properties and configuration information about how the value is accessed and information about how the value is displayed or represented.”

In other words, the characteristic is where the actual values and information is presented. Security parameters, units and other metadata concerning the information are also encapsulated in the characteristics.

## Conclusion

An analogy might be a storage room filled with filing cabinets and each filing cabinet has a number of drawers. The GATT profile in this analogy is the storage room. The cabinets are the services, and the drawers are characteristics holding various information. Some of the drawers might also have locks on them restricting the access to its information.
