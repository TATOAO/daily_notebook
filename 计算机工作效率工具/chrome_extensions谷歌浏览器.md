[Caret Mode Github Issue](https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/1642 ":)")


In caret mode, v (or V) take you visual (line) mode.
In visual mode, c takes you to caret mode.
In visual mode, o focuses the opposite end of the selection (as in vim). This allows you to position one end of the selection, hit o, then position the other end.
Find (/) works in caret and visual modes.


(真的太牛逼了
