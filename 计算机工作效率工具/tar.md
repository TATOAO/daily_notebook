The tar xzvf command is used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems to extract files from a .tar.gz or .tgz archive. The command is a combination of options passed to the tar utility, and each letter stands for a different option:

x: Extract files from an archive.
z: Filter the archive through gzip for decompression.
v: Verbose mode, which displays a list of files being extracted.
f: Use the following argument as the name of the archive file.
