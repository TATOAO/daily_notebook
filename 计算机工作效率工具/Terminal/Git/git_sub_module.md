To convert a directory in your existing Git repository into a Git submodule, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Split the Directory into a Standalone Repository**
**Goal:** Preserve the directory's history in a new repository.

1. **Clone your original repository** (to avoid altering the original directly):
   ```bash
   git clone original-repo-url split-repo
   cd split-repo
   ```

2. **Use `git filter-repo`** to extract the directory's history into a new repo:
   ```bash
   # Install git-filter-repo if not already installed
   # pip install git-filter-repo

   git filter-repo --subdirectory-filter path/to/directory
   ```
   - This moves the contents of `path/to/directory` to the root of the new repository and removes all other files.

3. **Push the new repository to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:username/new-submodule-repo.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

### **2. Remove the Directory from the Original Repository**
**Goal:** Clean the original repository of the directory and its history.

1. **Navigate back to your original repository**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/original-repo
   ```

2. **Remove the directory and its history**:
   ```bash
   git filter-repo --path path/to/directory --invert-paths
   ```
   - This removes all traces of `path/to/directory` from the repository's history.

3. **Push the cleaned history to GitHub** (force-push if necessary):
   ```bash
   git push origin main --force
   ```
   ⚠️ **Warning:** Force-pushing rewrites history. Coordinate with collaborators to avoid conflicts.

---

### **3. Add the New Repository as a Submodule**
**Goal:** Link the new standalone repository as a submodule in the original directory's location.

1. **Add the submodule**:
   ```bash
   git submodule add git@github.com:username/new-submodule-repo.git path/to/directory
   ```

2. **Commit and push the changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "chore: add submodule for path/to/directory"
   git push origin main
   ```

---

### **4. Final Steps**
- **Cloning the main repository**:
  Users will need to initialize and update submodules:
  ```bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules original-repo-url
  # OR after cloning:
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
  同步所有的子project

- **Updating the submodule**:
  Changes in the submodule must be committed and pushed separately in its own repository.

---

### **Troubleshooting**
- **Error: "Directory already exists"** when adding a submodule:
  - Temporarily move the directory out of the main repo:
    ```bash
    mv path/to/directory /tmp/directory-backup
    git submodule add ...  # Add submodule
    mv /tmp/directory-backup/* path/to/directory/
    rm -rf /tmp/directory-backup
    ```

- **Collaborators must re-clone**:
  After rewriting history, collaborators should:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git reset --hard origin/main
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

---

This workflow preserves the directory's history in the submodule while cleaning the main repository. Let me know if you need further clarification!

How to Delete a Git Submodule
I see that you already have a market submodule entry in your .gitmodules file, but it appears to be using a placeholder URL. You also have another submodule at app/market pointing to a real repository.
To completely delete a Git submodule (in this case, the market submodule), follow these steps:
Steps to Delete a Git Submodule
1. Remove the submodule entry from .gitmodules:

2. Remove the submodule from the Git index:
```bash
git rm --cached market
```
3.Remove the submodule directory:
```bash
rm -rf market
```
4. Remove the submodule from Git's internal .git/config:

```bash
git config --remove-section submodule.market
```

5. Remove the submodule directory from Git's internal storage:

```bash
rm -rf .git/modules/market
```
6. Commit the changes:
```bash
git add .gitmodules
git commit -m "Remove market submodule"
```
After completing these steps, the submodule will be completely removed from your repository.
If you want to fix the issue with the original error message, you should make sure that the URL in your .gitmodules file points to the actual repository you want to use, not a placeholder URL.
