# Index
Neo4j is by default indexed using Lucene. 
Lucene was built as a full text search toolbox 
(with Solr being the de facto search engine implementation). 
Since Lucene was intended to search over large amounts of text, my suspicion is that you can put as much text into a node as you want and it will work just fine.
