Great observation! Let’s clarify what’s happening:

### What You’re Seeing

- **Both `http://tatoao.com` and `https://tatoao.com` are online and serving your FastAPI app.**
- The HTTPS certificate is valid and issued by Google Trust Services, not Let's Encrypt.

### Why Is This Happening?

Your domain (`tatoao.com`) is **behind Cloudflare**.  
Cloudflare is acting as a reverse proxy for your site. Here’s what this means:

1. **Cloudflare provides its own SSL certificate** for your domain, so visitors always see a valid HTTPS certificate, even if your origin server (your nginx) does not have a certificate yet.
2. **Requests to your domain go through Cloudflare first**, then Cloudflare forwards them to your server.

### Certbot and Your Setup

- **You have not yet run Certbot** on your server, so your nginx is not (yet) serving with a Let’s Encrypt certificate.
- **Cloudflare is handling HTTPS for you** at the edge, so your site appears secure to visitors.

### What Should You Do Next?

#### If you want to use Let’s Encrypt on your origin server:
- You can still run Certbot and get a certificate for your server.
- You may need to temporarily “pause” Cloudflare or use the DNS-01 challenge (instead of HTTP-01) because Cloudflare can block Let’s Encrypt from reaching your server directly on port 80.

#### If you’re happy with Cloudflare’s SSL:
- You don’t strictly need to run Certbot unless you want end-to-end encryption (Cloudflare to your server) with a valid certificate.

## **Summary Table**

| Scenario                        | What you see now | What you need to do |
|----------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Cloudflare proxy + SSL enabled   | HTTPS works      | Certbot optional    |
| No Cloudflare, want HTTPS        | HTTP only        | Run Certbot         |
| Want full encryption (Cloudflare to origin) | HTTPS works, but origin may be HTTP or self-signed | Run Certbot, set Cloudflare SSL mode to "Full (strict)" |

- **If you’re fine with Cloudflare’s SSL:**  
  You don’t need to do anything else for HTTPS to work for visitors.
