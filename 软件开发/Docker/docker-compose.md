# 同时执行两个docker-compose project 会有覆盖的问题:

Ah, I see what’s happening 👀

Even though you tried to separate the two `docker-compose` projects with different ports, networks, and container names, there are still a few gotchas:

### 1. **Default project name collision**

When you run `docker compose up` (or `docker-compose up`) without specifying a project name, Compose derives a project name from the folder name.

That project name is used as a prefix for **container names, volumes, and networks**, *unless you explicitly override them*.

Example:

* In your first project, `elasticsearch_data` volume is actually called something like:

  ```
  <foldername>_elasticsearch_data
  ```
* In your second project, since it uses the same `elasticsearch_data` name, it tries to **reuse** the same volume.

So your second stack doesn’t completely “replace” the first one, but they’re clashing because they’re sharing named resources.

---

### 2. **Explicit `container_name`**

You set `container_name: elasticsearch` in the first project and
`container_name: rag-master-elasticsearch` in the second.

This prevents Compose from auto-prefixing. That means you’ve manually fixed some of the conflict (good ✅), but note:

* Explicit `container_name` removes the “project scoping” feature of Compose → makes it very easy to collide across projects.

If both projects used `container_name: elasticsearch`, the second `up` would stop the first one and reuse the name.
That’s why you see "replacement" happening.

---

### 3. **Volumes**

Both files define:

```yaml
volumes:
  elasticsearch_data:
    driver: local
```

That’s a named volume, and **Docker doesn’t namespace volume names by project**. So both stacks are pointing at the *same* `elasticsearch_data` volume.

That’s almost certainly why the data containers "collide".

---

✅ **How to properly separate them**

You have a few options:

#### Option A – Different project names (simple fix)

Run Compose with a project name:

```bash
docker compose -p proj1 up -d
docker compose -p proj2 up -d
```

This will scope networks and volumes differently:

* `proj1_elasticsearch_data`
* `proj2_elasticsearch_data`

But since you’ve hardcoded `container_name`, that part won’t get namespaced. So avoid setting `container_name` unless you really need it.

---

#### Option B – Rename resources in the YAML

Give each stack unique names:

```yaml
volumes:
  elasticsearch_data_proj1:
    driver: local
```

and in the other:

```yaml
volumes:
  elasticsearch_data_proj2:
    driver: local
```

And drop `container_name` unless you truly want a fixed global name.

---

#### Option C – Profiles / overrides

If these are variants of the same stack, you can merge them with Compose **profiles** or override files instead of maintaining two separate Compose files.

---

⚠️ **In summary**:
The "replacement" you’re seeing is because:

1. You use the same volume name (`elasticsearch_data`) → they overlap.
2. You explicitly set `container_name` in one project → Compose can’t scope it → conflicts across projects.
3. If you run without `-p`, Compose uses the folder name as the project name, so some resources collide silently.

👉 Best practice:

* Remove `container_name` unless you need it.
* Use unique volume names or `-p <project>` when running.

Do you want me to suggest a **cleaned-up version of your two files** where both can run in parallel without touching each other?
