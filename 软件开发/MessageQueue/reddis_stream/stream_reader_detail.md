# Starting ID parameter

'0' means "read from the very beginning of the stream" - all messages that exist in the stream
'$' would mean "read only new messages from now on" (messages added after this call)
A specific ID like '1640995200000-0' would mean "read messages starting from this specific ID

messages = r.xread({'mystream': '$'})
for stream, message_list in messages:
    for message_id, fields in message_list:
        print(f"ID: {message_id}, Fields: {fields}")




# Group Reading



The '>' in Redis Streams is a special ID used specifically with consumer groups. It's different from the '0' and '$' we discussed earlier.

## What '>' Means

When you use '>' with xreadgroup(), it means:

* "Give me messages that haven't been delivered to any consumer in this group yet"
* It's essentially saying "I want to claim new, unassigned messages for this consumer"

## Consumer Groups Context

The '>' only works with consumer groups (using xreadgroup), not with regular xread. In your utils/redis_client.py code:

python

Apply to redis_client...

```
python

messages =self.client.xreadgroup(
    group_name, 
    consumer_name, 
    {stream_name: '>'}, # This '>' means "new unassigned messages"**
    count=count,
    block=block
)

```

## How Consumer Groups Work

1. Multiple consumers can be part of the same group
2. Messages are distributed among consumers in the group
3. '>' tells Redis: "Give me messages that haven't been assigned to any consumer yet"
4. Once a consumer reads a message with '>', that message is assigned to that specific consumer

## Other Consumer Group IDs

* '>' - New messages not yet assigned to any consumer
* '0' - Messages that were delivered to this specific consumer but not acknowledged
* Specific ID - Messages starting from that ID that belong to this consumer

## Example Scenario

If you have 3 consumers in a group and 10 messages in the stream:* Consumer A using '>' might get messages 1, 4, 7

* Consumer B using '>' might get messages 2, 5, 8
* Consumer C using '>' might get messages 3, 6, 9

This ensures load balancing and no duplicate processing across consumers in the same group.

So '>' is essentially the "round-robin assignment" mechanism for consumer groups!
