# canary deployment

What is a canary deployment? A canary deployment is a progressive rollout of an application that splits traffic between an already-deployed version and a new version, rolling it out to a subset of users before rolling out fully.


# horizontal "scale-out" or vertical scaling "scale-up"
Scale Up（纵向扩展）和Scale Out（横向扩展）

"horizontal scaling" (or "scale-out") refers to adding more instances or machines to a system to handle increased load. This is like adding more servers to distribute traffic and computing tasks. For example, if a web application receives more traffic, additional server instances can be deployed to balance the load across them.

On the other hand, "vertical scaling" (or "scale-up") means increasing the resources of a single instance or server, such as adding more CPU, memory, or storage. Vertical scaling typically enhances performance on a single machine, but it has limits based on the hardware capacity, while horizontal scaling can theoretically continue by adding more instances.
