以下均讨论[等额本息]
PMT 返回偿还的每期的总值(payment) (rate,nper,pv,fv,type)
IPMT 第nper期返回偿还的利息(I - Interest 利息) (rate, per, nper, pv, [fv], [type])
PPMT 第nper期返回偿还的利息(P - Principal 本金) (rate, per, nper, pv, [fv], [type])

举例:
利息4.5%, 30年，500w
```swift
=PMT(4.5%/12, 360, 5000000)
=-25334.26549 // 默认返回一个负数

=IPMT(4.5%/12, 360, 1, 5000000)
=-25334.26549 // 默认返回一个负数

=PPMT(4.5%/12, 360, 1, 5000000)
=-25334.26549 // 默认返回一个负数
```



Description
Returns the interest payment for a given period for an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.

Syntax
IPMT(rate, per, nper, pv, [fv], [type])

The IPMT function syntax has the following arguments:

Rate    Required. The interest rate per period.

Per    Required. The period for which you want to find the interest and must be in the range 1 to nper.

Nper    Required. The total number of payment periods in an annuity.

Pv    Required. The present value, or the lump-sum amount that a series of future payments is worth right now.

Fv    Optional. The future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If fv is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (the future value of a loan, for example, is 0).

Type    Optional. The number 0 or 1 and indicates when payments are due. If type is omitted, it is assumed to be 0.
